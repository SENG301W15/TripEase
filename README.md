# SENG-301-Project

How to Build:

    Our app can be run by loading it in Xcode 6.2 and then by accessing the Product menu from the title bar and selecting Run.  For the most accurate results, make sure that the iOS keyboard is enabled in the iOS Simulator by accessing the Hardware menu from the title bar and selecting Keyboard > Toggle Software Keyboard.

Unfortunately we were unable to use a code coverage tool to measure the amount of code covered by our unit tests (apparently calculating line coverage in XCode is non-trivial).
